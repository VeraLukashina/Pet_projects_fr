# French Collèges: A Data-Driven Look at Educational Quality (analyse_du_brevet_collèges_français)

This project focuses on analyzing the results of the Diplôme National du Brevet (DNB), the national middle school exam in France, from 2006 to 2021.

The goal of the project is to help families in Étaules (Charente-Maritime) choose the most suitable local collège by comparing nearby schools based on their Brevet exam performance. The analysis includes national success rate trends, regional disparities, a comparison of public vs. private schools, and a specific focus on collèges accessible from Étaules.
